## End to End MAchine Learning Project
This deals with EDA and building various ML models using sklearn:
KNeighborsRegressor
DecisionTreeRegressor
RandomForestRegressor,AdaBoostRegressor
LinearRegression, Ridge,Lasso
CatBoostRegressor
XGBRegressor

And performing HP using RandomizedSearchCV

Developed Flask based mini web app to access the model and re-use for prediction
